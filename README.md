## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Perhaps I'm just making excuses, but my mind have been hazy for the past couple of days. I can't seem to focus and I don't know what's happening with me. Despite that, I still manage to try this bento grid challenge. I know it's not perfect and there are still some fixing needed, but I am pretty satisfied with the result, given my condition right now. I am just happy to learn about grid again and doing it with Tailwind CSS.
